# Runs the linter. Regrettably the linter is very simple and does not provide the ability to exclude rules or files,
# so we rely on inverse grepping to do this for us.
#
# Piping a bunch of greps may be slower than `grep -vE (thing|otherthing|anotherthing|etc)`, but since we have a good
# amount of things we're excluding, it seems better to optimize for readability.
#
# Note: since we added the linter after-the-fact, some of the ignored errors here are because we can't change an
# existing interface. (as opposed to us not caring about the error)
